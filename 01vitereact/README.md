# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# *npm create vite@latest* to create project with vite library

# *npm install* *npm run dev*

# *RULE* vite library only support/execute the file name with ".jsx" instead of ".js" 

# *RULE* function/tag/exporting_value i.e components should only be *Caputalized* in every React library

# *RULE FOR VITE LIBRARY* jsx that it will only return/export 1 element , so for returning  multiple element will use "<>....</>" which called as fragmented element where we store every other multiple element that we want to return 

# *RULE FOR BASIC REACT* in normal react if it returns html will use  ".jsx" extention & if only js code is returning will use ".js "
